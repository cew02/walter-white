Walter White's "Say my name" monolugue from the hit AMC TV show *Breaking Bad*

## About

This is code for the Season 5 Episode 7 episode of *Breaking Bad*. This is the scene of the same name of the episode, "Say My Name". In order to make the code move along, you must type the exact phrasing and puncuation of that scene, or you lose. 

## Why?

I wanted something fun to code in order to test my knowledge of if else statements in python. 
While it's basic code, I did this by myself, and I am very proud of it. More to come :)

## More Info

This is also more of a practice repository for one particular thing, rather than many different languages in one repo. More is to come :)
