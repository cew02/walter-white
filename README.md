walter white's "say my name"

While you can say practically anything to make the code move along, it is recommended that you type the exact words that Walter White said in the season five episode "Say My Name"

While it's basic code, I did this by myself, and I am very proud of it. More to come :)

This is also more of a practice repository for one particular thing, rather than many different languages in one repo.
